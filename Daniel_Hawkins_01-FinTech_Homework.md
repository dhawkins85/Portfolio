# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Background

As a FinTech professional, it is critical to learn how FinTech companies start, evolve, and grow, and to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the FinTech space. Even those in a highly technical role must stay abreast of what is happening in the business landscape, as many FinTech companies create tools and technologies that are then used by other companies.

One of the key methods used to conduct corporate analysis is the **case study**. Case studies are often 50–100 pages or more, but your task is to create a more focused case study that analyzes how a FinTech company is responding to the problems and needs of the FinTech domain it is in, and how it is using technology to solve a standing financial problem.

In this homework assignment, you will:

* Select a Fintech domain that interests you, and then choose a company or project within that domain.

* Research the domain and company.

* Write a detailed case study of the company.

* Upload your case study to your git repository.

This assignment will challenge you to polish your FinTech research skills by accessing reports, publications, and online resources that FinTech professionals use to evaluate the industry. It will also help you situate the techniques and technologies you will be mastering in this course––e.g., machine learning, Python, modeling, blockchain––within the real world of global FinTech. Finally, it will give you practice presenting and speaking about FinTech strategy and technology.

## Instructions

### 1. Choose a FinTech domain that you find relevant or interesting.

**Note:** We covered a number of FinTech domains in class this week. If you already have a company in mind that you want to research, skip ahead to Step 3.

* Payments/Billing

* Capital Investment

* Investment Management

* Wealth Management

* Enterprise Solutions

* Insurance (InsurTech)

* Mortgage/Real Estate

* Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking

* Lending

* Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

* Regulation Technology (RegTech)

* Open Banking

* Robo-advising

Remember that because FinTech is an evolving field, different FinTech reports may use different names and definitions for various domains and sectors (e.g., CB Insights, Investopedia, Accenture). In addition, you may come across lists of FinTech domains online that are either longer or shorter than the list above; there is no one comprehensive list.

### 2. Choose a company (or project) within  your chosen Fintech domain.

Use online research to identify the trends in your domain, and choose a company that is successful or otherwise interesting to you. For example, if you chose Wealth Management, you may want to look at online journals, periodicals, reports, and websites about the future of Wealth Management, or how FinTech is changing or disrupting Wealth Management.

Your company could be:

* A new, emerging FinTech company that is doing well in a particular domain. Examples include Square, Plaid, Lemonade, RobinHood, and Coinbase.

* A large incumbent financial or technology company that is doing something interesting and new with technology. Examples include Goldman Sachs’ Marcus, JP Morgan’s JPMCoin, Facebook Libra, and Apple Card.

* A smaller start-up that is not yet wildly successful, but that you find promising and interesting. This may include a FinTech company in your local area or a company with a new idea that you would like to learn more about.

### 3. Conduct your research, using the case study template as a guide.

We recommend that you use the case study template below in order to focus your research. You may lengthen, shorten, or––if necessary––remove sections from the template to accommodate the information available about your company.

**Note** If you have chosen a project within a larger company (such as the Apple Credit Card), you may want to focus your research on the origins and scope of the project rather than on the company itself.

# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
United Health Group

* When was the company incorporated?
January 1977
* Who are the founders of the company?
Richard Taylor Burke
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
1974: Mr. Burke founded Charter Med Inc, in Minnetonka, MN, USA. Began as a private company.
1977: United HealthCare Corp formed to restructure and acquire Charter Med. United HealthCare's charter detailed the management of Physicians Health Plan of MN, a newly created health management organization.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
UHG is a for-profit medical insurance and healthcare conglomerate, the largest in entire world by revenue.  

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Since COVID's catastrophic impacts to every aspect of today's world, businesses were forced to make critical decisions to continue operating. Since incorporating, UHG had been acquiring privately owned clinics and further securing the company's growth and position in several industries. One such industry was the emerging technology of virtual-business, in customer-service interactions, as well as facilitating internal operations. A small company UHG previously acquired had the R&D for video-visits all polished and ready to be implemented in the world, but lacked the credibility and resources to execute large-scale implementation. Logistics, funding, and other scalability issues the would've been impossible to overcome for a smaller business were switfly and deftly handled with UHG at the helm.
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
UHG's intended customer is any and every person in the world, currently serving customers in 123 countries at the time of writing.
I personally believe that UHG likely possesses the world's most expansive and voluminous library of consumer information databases, however due to the inherent sensitivity of the information I am unable to verify this. Taking a step back from personally identifiable information, one could venture that any country, state, or locality which regularly collects information about citizens is creating a foundation of market size and customer information. An example of this would be access to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services patient databases. That concrete dataset could then be used to extrapolate specific information or models about a targeted demographic or area of interest to UHG. 
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The solutions offered by UHG are innumerable. Being the global leader in insurance, the resources available to them offer access to even more powerful resources. As the adage goes, "Money talks", and after decades of success, they have positioned themselves to where smaller insurance companies go unnoticed because of their relative insignificance to UHG. They've extended their focus into large-scale corporate optimization, learning from their own performance and results. UHG has the capital and infrastructure to make a mistake or two along the way without any noticeable impact to the health of the company. Whereas if a smaller company made the same exact mistake, the fallout could possibly tarnish their reputation or bankrupt them. I would say another unfair advantage would be the impervious mergers and acquisitions of UHG. If a smaller outfit has some trade secrets, valuable innovation, or some other intellectual property UHG assesses as valuable, their dominance and resources allow them to simply acquire the smaller company.  
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
As with any modern company, the use of teleconferencing has become absolutely essential to operations. Some other backend technologies utilized are Google Analytics, Adobe Experience Manager, jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap, and Handlebars.js. An example of these technologies being used their past and current foray into streamlining digital healthcare. More recently Humana, MultiPlan, Optum, Quest Diagnostics and UnitedHealthcare came together and created Synaptic Health Alliance. This organization aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data management for the entire healthcare industry; and they are doing it with blockchains.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
The identifying domain the UHG occupies would be the insurance domain. However, with their exponential growth and need to sustain said growth, their space in the business world transcends a lot of traditional black-and-white definitions. The term "InsurTech" is a working-title umbrella term that decribes both the smaller innovative up-and-comers entering the industry, which are acquired by massive corporations like UHG, therefore dictating UHG as an InsurTech company.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
As with most industry frontrunners, setting the standard and quickly improving that standard is vital to success. The broad term "connectivity" encompasses many innovations that are disrupting the insurance industry. All information delapidates over time. Sure, it can be always used as a reference point or historic documentation, but most companies would rather conduct their business with forward-thinking. An example: Company A is forming market strategies and planning future projects using data from 2019, and Company B is doing the same thing but with all data from 2020-21, which is constantly updated through their superior connectivity technology, it is logical that Company B has a monumental upper-hand over Company A. Digging deeper into these practices, we find subsets of innovations which "connectivity" is comprised of. One of these components is a "contextual ecosystem". By clearly, logically, and credibly presenting insurance as an essential part of every person's life, it's simple to generate interest. In 2010, generating interest in healthcare became irrelevant - in the United States at least - since that's when legislation was passed requiring all citizens to own and maintain medical insurance. The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act put the healthcare industry into overdrive, and companies had to adapt, shift priorities, and reevaluate their strategies on maintaining competitiveness in the newborn market of lawfully obligated customers. 
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
A few other companies operating in the insurance and InsurTech domain are CVS Health Corporation, which isn't directly in the insurance space, but strategic alliances stemming from the interdependence of the healthcare and pharmacy process, the amalgamation of these industries is right around the corner. Another company in this space is Cigna Corporation, trailing in annual revenue by almost $100B (As of 2020). Closely following behind Cigna is Cardinal Health Incorporated.
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The business impacts of UHG have been remarkably diverse thus far. Constant changes to consumer legislation on one end, dwarfed by the complex nature of consistent regulatory changes have kept the company busy. Rarely is legislation or regulatory requirements replaced, they are simply addended with the new requirements. So when politicians and regulatory committees complete one "project", and pass bills into law and regulators prescribe new standards, they are also creating a recurring project at the absolute minimum for any business or individual affected, simply from risk management and compliance standpoints. So when huge companies like UHG are prompted to adapt to additional checks-and-balances, they've got to figure out what action is needed, what practices to be ceased, and the most efficient way to achieve compliance. Through doing so, large companies naturally set the stage for all the changes required to go from 2020 Compliance to 2021 Compliance, and smaller companies can observe them, and then learn, adapt, and adopt any new practices in their own capacities as they see fit. Simply having the flexibility to withstand the brunt of "growing pains", large corporations are pioneering the business models of tomorrow. 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
As with any business, insurance companies need to constantly measure and assess their success. Part of this process is analyzing past performance and projecting future performance with metrics. Some examples of metrics are annual revenue, customer relations, customer retention and acquisition, stock price (if a public company), employee morale, to name a few. This is not an extensive list, as new metrics are being formulated and quantified every day. Using the few metrics on UHG I have access to, they are doing fantastic! Consistent year-over-year growth in annual revenue and stock price. According to some employer rating systems, they seem to have above-average morale internally, with an average score of 3.7/5 from current and former employees.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
UHG has been, and continues to be at the helm of the healthcare industry. UHG reported an annual revenue of $240.3B for 2020, a staggering lead from their closest competitor, Cigna, reporting their 2020 earnings at $153.7B. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I know very little about insurance and the business side of that, so I don't feel my suggestions would be of any value. From a consumer perspective, I would eagerly suggest something along the lines of a BOGO sale. Buy a policy for a year, get a second year of coverage for free. Maybe buy a policy for yourself, get one for your car/bike/pet/home for free. Many companies offer bundling discounts, but given that the entire concept of insurance is speculative, I don't understand how value could be concretely quantified, and I personally don't think that it ever could be. Additionally I would advise an addition to services they offer employees. I don't know what they have formerly offered or currently offer, but I personally need to know I'm valued by an employer. Free daycare, company sponsored outings at a park or fair, things like that. Not only is generating positive morale fun simply for the experience, but it is a clear sign of appreciation outside of just a paycheck or frivilous award certificate. It also creates a new atmosphere in which people can be less professional and more human, fostering meaningful connections and understanding of people for who they actually are, and not the title on their desk or door.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
See above
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Honestly, my suggestions are pretty basic. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

### 4. Write the case study.

Write the finished case study report in a markdown `README.md` file, using the above case study template. Your report should be sufficiently long to ensure you provide all relevant information about the company or project in a thorough manner.

Be sure to cite your sources in an addendum at the end of the report. List all websites, podcasts, blogs, or articles that you consulted in order to write the report, and provide links. Your list should be thorough and account for all sources you used, but it does not need to be a formal works cited page.


### 5. Upload your case study to your git repository.

You learned some technical aspects of FinTech this week, including how to set up and populate a git repository. As a final step, take your finished case study and upload it to a repository to share with your instructor and class.
